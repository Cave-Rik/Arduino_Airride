# Arduino_Airride
Quick and dirty Arduino sketch for turning an analog airride set to digital.
Specially written for M. Hettema and his Passat 35i.

Be sure to import the OneButton library into your Arduino app before compiling. It can be found here : https://github.com/mathertel/OneButton.git
This airride setup can be expanded to a system with digital pressure sensors for more accurate inflation of the airride forks, as well as a screen to display the 
current inflation of the forks.
